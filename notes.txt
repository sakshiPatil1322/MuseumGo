Key Points for Implementation
Role-Based Access Control: Ensure that admin routes are protected and only accessible by users with the admin role.
Separate Navigation: Provide distinct navigation menus for users and admins, tailored to their needs.
Unified Authentication: Use a common authentication mechanism but redirect users based on their roles after login.
These routes will provide the essential functionalities required for both user types, ensuring a smooth user experience and effective management of the museum's online presence.
